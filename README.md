7.26.2014 - Repo created

This dataset and script were created for the Getting and Cleaning Data course offered by Jeff Leek, PhD, Brian Caffo, PhD, Roger D. Peng, PhD through Coursera.

The original data was taken on 7/26/2014 from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

In order to perform the script, the reshape2 package must be installed, and the original data taken from the link above must be unzipped in the working directory.

The dataset provided shows the averages of measurements taken from accelerometers and gyroscopes for various activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, or laying) for 30 volunteer subjects as recorded by the Samsung Galaxy S II).

The resulting dataset is provided as tidydata.txt

The script saves the resulting analysis into the R object "data".
